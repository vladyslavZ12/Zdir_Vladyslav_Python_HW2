# Rock Paper Scissors in Python!
 
### Pick your weapon and play against the computer - you'll only get a virtual sting if you lose!
 
Prerequisites: All you need is [Python3](https://www.python.org/)  to play.
 
Clone the project, navigate to the correct directory, - `cd directory name` - and run the `game.py` file in a Python Terminal window for macOS/Linux.
 
The rules are the same as the classic game:
1. Paper covers Rock
2. Scissors cuts Paper
3. Rock smashes Scissors
 
*Choose your weapon wisely!*
 
The computer chooses first; just follow the prompts.
 
Built with Python 3.
